As a greedy algorithm, it has one major downside: it requires an exponential amount of space to store the length 2^n de Bruijn sequence. Though de Bruijn sequences have been heavily studied over the last 60 years, finding an efficient construction for the Prefer-same de Bruijn sequence has remained a tantalizing open problem. In this paper, we unveil the underlying structure of the Prefer-same de Bruijn sequence and solve the open problem by presenting an efficient algorithm to construct it using O(n) time per bit and only O(n) space. Following a similar approach, we also present an efficient algorithm to construct the Prefer-opposite de Bruijn sequence.",

For higher powers of 2, the theory of orthogonal designs is used to set a priori relations between cell probabilities, in order to establish the construction. Simulations are given to illustrate the sensitivity of various components to changes in location, scale, skewness and tail probability, as well as to illustrate the potential improvement in power when the cell probabilities are changed.",

The well-known prefer-one, prefer-opposite, and prefer-same binary de Bruijn sequences are all constructed using appropriate preference functions. In this article we provide some fairly general results that give conditions for a pair of an initial word and a preference function on a q-ary alphabet to produce sequences that include every pattern of given size n &#8805; 1–except possibly some specified set of patterns. We provide several old and new constructions that showcase the flexibility of the results. Specifically, we give a construction for square-free and general separative de Bruijn sequences. The existence of these sequences was established more than a decade ago but nonconstructively. An important special case of these separative sequences produces universal cycles for permutations. We also build a preference function for binary de Bruijn sequences of patterns with a maximum density of ones. As for full de Bruijn sequences, the main result helps furnish a recursive construction from arbitrary cyclic permutations of q symbols. Finally, we build a preference function that extends a full de Bruijn sequence of order n into one of order n + 1.",

Although openPDS protects the user's raw data, sensitive personal information, such as location trace, can still be inferred by the service provider by analyzing the accumulated answers. In this paper, we aim to append openPDS with a module that prevents the service provider from reconstructing the trace of users. This module abides with the QoS requirements necessitated by the provider, and defined as the tolerance of the application to inaccurate answers. Our approach was tested on 10 users whose locations traces were recorded for 10 months. Results show that no user trace was successfully reconstructed even when high QoS levels were required.",

In this paper, we characterize preference functions that generate full de Bruijn sequences. More significantly, we establish that any preference function that generates a de Bruijn sequence of order n also generates de Bruijn sequences of all orders higher than n, thus making the Ford sequence no special case.
